				<p> If you asked my peers about me, they would probably say that I am positive, resourceful, and determined. I was a young mother and was so proud when I finished college.  I wanted to be a teacher.  However, the cruel brutality of children was too much for my peaceful way of life.  If you have someone in your life that is a teacher, give them a hug, they need it!</p>

				<p2> I dipped my toes in a few different professions after that, trying to find career paths that interested me.  In the meantime, I practiced my graphic design, which I studied in college as well.  Most importantly, I helped to build a business and website called 512ATX, which is a "search by category" site containing every restaurant and bar in Austin, Texas. I also worked on a site called Down To Fest, which sold and promoted clothing and accessories made by vendors in the music festival community.  For the past 4 months, I have been working on my own site, DiscoThreads, a retail store featuring my own graphics.  It has been my baby ever since. </p2><br><br>

				<p3> When I heard about the UT Bootcamp, I knew immediately that it would help to expand my personal endeavors.  I would love to be a part of a successful company, but I would like to create a company and help others achieve success as well.  </p3>
