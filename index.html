			<p> If you asked my peers about me, they would probably say that I am positive, resourceful,
				and determined. I was a young mother and was so proud when I finished college.
				I wanted to be a teacher. However, the cruel brutality of children was too much
				for my peaceful way of life. If you have someone in your life that is a teacher,
				give them a hug, they need it!
				<br>
				<br>

				I dipped my toes in a few different professions after that, trying to find
				career paths that interested me. In the meantime, I practiced my graphic design,
				which I studied in college as well. Most importantly, I helped to build a business and
				website called 512ATX, which is a "search by category" site containing every restaurant
				and bar in Austin, Texas. I also worked on a site called Down To Fest, which sold and
				promoted clothing and accessories made by vendors in the music festival community.
				For the past 4 months, I have been working on my own site, DiscoThreads, a retail store
				featuring my own graphics. It has been my baby ever since.
				<br>
				<br>

				When I heard about the UT Bootcamp, I knew immediately that it would help to
				expand my personal endeavors. I would love to be a part of a successful company,
				but I would like to create a company and help others achieve success as well. </p>
